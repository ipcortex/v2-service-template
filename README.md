## Using the template

1. Follow [Creating a repository from a template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) and create an appropriately named repository. Prefixed with V2 for new platform microservices.
2. Clone and Pull your new repository and set up a "dev" branch
3. Change the service name in package.json file to the correct name
4. Change the file names and class names to the correct context (eg. TemplateController to PhoneBookController)
5. If unsure do not hesitate to ask

### Private NPM package

The microservice template has a dependency on our private NPM package. Please reach out to ensure that you have access.
